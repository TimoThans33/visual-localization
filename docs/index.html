        <h1>Visual Localization Design Document</h1>
        <p>This document describes the proposed software architectures for indoor localization of autonomous machines. 
        </p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
             This project aims to localize autonomous robots using image processing algorithms. I have heard we sometimes do image processing at Prime Vision ;p
             It has to at least include the following features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Optic Flow for speed estimation of the Robot</li>
            <li>Absolute Positioning</li>
            <li>No Need for seperate devices (except for maybe an accesspoint and server) or adjustments on the environment</li>
            <li>Less then 5mm precission</li>
            <li>More than 30 updates per second</li>
            <li>Ability to learn while driving</li>
            <li>Algorithms rather implemented from scratch</li>
            <li>Cheaper than 2000$</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pre-liminary work</h3>
        <p>
            We have build three set-ups for testing. First is a PCB design for the Ilumination. The second is a cover for the PCB design and camera.
            The third is a cart that can be either pushed or driven with a controller. The camera in the set-up is a basler camera.
            The images appear to be of a good enough quality to do something. But this design is not final.

            Furtheremore there is some throw-away code for real-time video streaming to see the feed on your computer

        <h3>Proposed solutions</h3>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h4>Optic Flow Algorithm</h4>
                <p>
                    Can both be used with a floor and camera pointed to the ceiling.
                </p>

            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h4>Image Stitching Algorithm with SIFT</h4>
                <p>Maybe in combination with WLAN based Localization. Could be useful with both a floor and ceiling camera</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h4>K Means Clustering</h4>   
                <p>Maybe in combination with WLAN based localization and could also be used with both a floor and cealing camera</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <h4>Relative Positioning with depth data</h4>
                <p>True swarming algorithm. Determine its position within the fleet of robots.</p>
            </div>

    <h3>Milestones</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>PCB design v0.1 + Mechanical Design v0.1 (June)</li>
        <li>Real Time Video Streaming (June)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Future work</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Decide what technique we are going with</li>
        <li>Better hardware design</li>
        <li>Optimizing Costs and Processing speed (maybe FPGA? Optimized CUDA code)</li>
    </ul>
